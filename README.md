# heart-disease-prediction
This project compares a self-built Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to traditional machine learning models (Random Forest and XGBoost) for predicting heart disease based on clinical data. Includes data preprocessing, model implementation, performance evaluation (15-fold cross-validation), and feature importance analysis.
